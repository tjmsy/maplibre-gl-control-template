## Code Overview
The core implementation is in [src/CustomControlTemplate.js](./src/CustomControlTemplate.js).  
It provides the following basic structure:

```javascript
class CustomControl {
    constructor(options = {}) {
        this.options = options;
    }

    onAdd(map) {
        // Logic for when the control is added to the map
    }

    onRemove() {
        // Logic for when the control is removed from the map
    }
}
```

You can extend this to add your desired functionality.
